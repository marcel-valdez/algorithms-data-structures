This project will contain the topics of algorithms and data structures found in the book:
Algorithms 4th Ed by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

The folders doc, src and test will have the same structure:
* doc/ folder contains my analysis about a given algorithm.
* src/ folder contains the Ruby code for the algorithm
* test/ folder contains tests for the algorithm, not that I will (for the most part) use TDD for the development of these algorithms.

Wish me luck!
