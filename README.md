This project will contain the topics of algorithms and data structures found in the book:
             Algorithms 4th Ed by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

The folders doc, src and test will have the same structure:
* src/ contains the Ruby code for the algorithm
* src/utils/ contains utilities for implementing the algorithms
* test/ contains tests for the algorithm, note that I will (for the most part) use TDD for the development of these algorithms.

Folder organization:
src/
